# bushfireApp

bushfireApp is an R package that bundles: - a cleaned dataset of annual
temperature anomalies (relative to the 1861–1890 baseline), - an
interactive Shiny app to explore that dataset, - reproducible
documentation.

The goal is to let users see how global (and Australian) temperatures
have shifted over time relative to a “pre-industrial” baseline.
