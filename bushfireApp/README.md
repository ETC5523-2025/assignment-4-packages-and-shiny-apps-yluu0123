# bushfireApp

**bushfireApp** is an R package that bundles:  
- a cleaned dataset of annual temperature anomalies (relative to the 1861–1890 baseline),  
- an interactive **Shiny App** to explore that dataset, and  
- reproducible documentation for reproducible research.

The goal is to let users see how global (and regional) temperatures have shifted over time relative to a “pre-industrial” baseline.
