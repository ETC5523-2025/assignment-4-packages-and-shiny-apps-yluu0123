# bushfireApp

bushfireApp is an R package that bundles:
- a cleaned dataset of annual temperature anomalies (relative to the 1861–1890 baseline),
- an interactive Shiny app to explore that dataset,
- reproducible documentation.

The goal is to let users see how global (and Australian) temperatures have shifted over time relative to a “pre-industrial” baseline.
